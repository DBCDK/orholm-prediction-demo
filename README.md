# orholm-prediction-demo
Code snippets demonstrating model building and prediction for the National Museum of Denmark's storage facilities, Ã˜rholm.

You can find stuff in these folders:

* `notebooks` - Jupyter Notebooks that contain the code used for building the model used for predictions, and the code that does the predictions.
* `model-data` - data files containing measurements of humidity and temperature for three storage locations every hour in five years.
* `prebuilt-models` - prebuilt model files that can be loaded with `joblib` in case you want to make your own predictions but do not want to build the model.
* `predict-example-data` - example of the data that is used to feed into the models when predicting future humidity.
