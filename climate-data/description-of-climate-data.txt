For all data “.” is used as decimal divider.
For each hourly recording in all data sets the absolute humidity of air (AH) was calculated from the temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) by the equation: AH=(1322,9*(RH/100)*EKSP(T/(T+238,3)*17,2694)/(T+273,16))
The unit of AH is grams of water vapor per cubic meter of air.
